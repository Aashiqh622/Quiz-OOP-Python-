Overview:
Quiz-OOP-Python is a sophisticated console-based quiz game implemented in Python, designed to showcase the practical application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This project emphasizes code modularity, reusability, and readability, making it an excellent demonstration of best practices in Python development.

Key Features
Data-driven Quiz Content: The quiz questions are stored in a separate data.py file, allowing easy customization and expansion of the question bank.

Modular Question Handling: The QuestionAns class in question_model.py encapsulates the question and answer logic, promoting clean code architecture.

Intelligent Quiz Engine: The Quiz class in quiz_brain.py serves as the brain of the quiz, managing the flow of questions, tracking scores, and providing immediate feedback to the player.

Efficient Main Execution: The main.py file orchestrates the entire quiz, importing the necessary components, initializing the quiz, and seamlessly guiding the user through the quiz experience.
